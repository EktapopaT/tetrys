# Tetrys
Tetris as Progressive Web Application

## Development :wrench:
This application _requires_ Node.js `>=6.0.0` to run locally and the [Redux DevTools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=en) for debugging Redux applications.

To get started, `npm install` all dependencies. To run the application in **development** mode, use the `npm run dev` command. A **production** build can be created with `npm run build`.
